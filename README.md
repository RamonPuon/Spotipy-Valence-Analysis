## Radiohead Analysis

Music is everywhere, it is part of our daily lives, and streaming services like spotify have made it easy for everyone to access all kinds of music. At any time you can listen to a large part of the catalog of multiple artists. All this amount of content generates a wide range of information, data about our favorite songs that can give us interesing insights about them.

This is my first attempt to analyze the Radiohead discography, using the Python library [Spotipy] (https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.19.0/) for handling the Spotify Web API. 

This is still a work in progress, so far I have analyzed the audio features of the songs from each album. Starting with the variable Valence, which according to Spotify's documentation it is a: 
> A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
